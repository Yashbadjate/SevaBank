Hello Everyone,This is my Task 1 Basic Banking system of the spark foundation internship
In this project I have used HTML ,CSS ,Javascript. 
In this project on Home page added 1 button named as transfer money after clicking on that button customer list is visible
I have created dummy users in database with their details of Sr.No., EmailId, Name , Amount and one transfer button through which they can transfer money to other users. 
On that page there are two buttons in center transfer and Transaction History.
